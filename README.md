# Good Pets

Good Pets is a social media app for your pets. You can create an account and make a profile for you and your pet. You can then post pictures of your pets, as well as comment and like other posts.

## Heroku site

This app is hosted on Heroku at https://project-mod-2.herokuapp.com/

### Image linking

This app is not able to host images. They must be linked from other image hosting sites. We recommend using Imgur and pasting the direct links of your images into the image url fields.

### Setting up a profile

To sign up a user must provide an email, password, and name, along with an optional bio and profile image.

A pet profile can then be created for that user. A pet profile will need a name and age, along with an optional field for hobbies, an image, and a birthdate.

### Using Good Pets

The main page of Good Pets will have all the posts made, sorted by most recent. From there a user can like or comment a post. They can also create their own post with an image and a description. Users have the ability to edit or delete their own profiles, their pet profiles, and their posts.
